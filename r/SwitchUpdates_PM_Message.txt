r/SwitchUpdates

When r/NintendoSwitch started getting more circlejerk-y and r/tomorrow started getting more and more popular due to the unnecessary and stupid posts, r/SwitchUpdates was made so people who only cares about news can join it and get all the benefits of r/NintendoSwitch without the content of r/tomorrow.

The sub’s name was mentioned a few times in r/tomorrow and r/NintendoSwitch, which got it about 200 members. However, the quality mods at r/NintendoSwitch and r/tomorrow has banned all mentions of r/SwitchUpdates, which is why you’re receiving this message in PM form instead of comment form.
